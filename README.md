# Quantum-Inspired Genetic Algorithm for Antenna Positioning

## üì° Overview
This project implements a Quantum-Inspired Genetic Algorithm (QGA) to optimize antenna positioning for telecom companies in Tunisia. By combining classical genetic algorithms with quantum computing principles, we significantly improve the efficiency and coverage of antenna placements.
